Any use of the Software:
- to operate a paid product or service,
- to provide hosting, SaaS, or marketplace functionality,
- to embed or bundle the Software inside proprietary systems,
- to generate revenue, sales, referral income, or other monetary benefit,

## 2. License Grant

The Licensor grants Licensee a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license** to use the Software for Commercial Use **subject to the terms of this Agreement**.

This commercial license overrides the copyleft requirements of the AGPL-3.0 **only for Licensee’s permitted commercial activities**.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

## 3. Permitted Commercial Activities

Under this license, the Licensee may:

1. **Operate a private, internal deployment** of BioMP without open-sourcing modifications.  
2. **Embed BioMP** into a commercial product, workflow, or platform.  
3. **Offer hosted, SaaS-like, or automated services** powered by the Software.  
4. **Modify, extend, and integrate** the Software for internal or commercial use.

## 4. Restrictions

Under this license, the Licensee may **not**:

1. **Repackage, resell, or offer BioMP as a competing marketplace or SaaS** without a separate written agreement.  
2. **Remove attribution** to the Licensor where reasonably displayed.  
3. **Use the Software to create a substantially similar or derivative marketplace** that bypasses the Licensor’s referral or transaction model.  
4. **Circumvent or disable** vendor tracking, referral systems, or revenue-sharing mechanisms built into the Software.  
5. **Publish or distribute the Software** under a different license.  

If Licensee wishes to do any of the above, a custom commercial license must be arranged.

## 5. Referral & Revenue-Sharing Terms

For marketplace deployments, Licensee agrees that:

1. **Vendors acquiring leads or customers through the Software** may be subject to a referral or transaction fee.  
2. The default fee is **5% of net revenue generated directly from matches facilitated by the Software**, unless otherwise agreed in writing.  
3. Alternative arrangements (flat fees, tiered fees, capped fees, or zero-fee academic use) may be negotiated separately.  
4. Licensee must not intentionally disable or obscure referral tracking mechanisms.

These fees support the ongoing development and sustainability of BioMP.
