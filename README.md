# BioMP  
**An Intelligent, Open-Source Marketplace for Biotech & Biopharma Services**

BioMP is an AI-driven, community-focused marketplace that connects scientists, biotech teams, and biopharma organizations with the exact assays, bioinformatics pipelines, CRO services, and technical capabilities they need — instantly.  

Users simply describe their scientific need, and BioMP’s agent-powered intelligence scopes requirements, proposes workflows, and matches the best-fit vendors from a growing knowledgebase of biotech capabilities.

BioMP accelerates research, strengthens vendor discovery, and enables a more connected, efficient biotech ecosystem.

# 🌟 Key Features

### **🧠 Agent-Powered Scoping & Matching**
BioMP uses specialized AI agents with their own “brains” to:
- Understand scientific requests  
- Build structured project specifications  
- Propose analysis pipelines or assay workflows  
- Match users to qualified vendors  
- Highlight risks, constraints, and tradeoffs  

### **🔬 Central Biotech Knowledgebase**
A continuously expanding, transparent repository of:
- Vendor capabilities  
- Assay types  
- Omics workflows  
- Regulatory tags and constraints  
- Evidence, certifications, and outcomes  

### **📁 Project-Specific Workspaces**
Every project has an isolated memory space containing:
- ProjectCards  
- Scoping artifacts  
- Pipeline proposals  
- Shortlists & rankings  
- Risk assessments  

This ensures privacy, reproducibility, and clean separation of concerns.

### **🔌 Vendor Ecosystem Integration**
BioMP helps vendors reach more customers by:
- Making capabilities discoverable  
- Matching them directly to qualified leads  
- Standardizing project intake  
- Enabling optional referral-based partnerships  

### **🌱 Open-Source, Community-Driven**
The core platform is open-source to accelerate biotech progress, democratize access to expert-level scoping, and support new scientific innovation.

# 🚀 Why BioMP Exists

Biotech innovation is slowed by:
- fragmented vendor discovery  
- unclear requirements  
- emails and long back-and-forth scoping  
- inconsistent pricing and lead times  
- lack of transparent expertise mapping  

BioMP turns this into:
- instant scoping  
- transparent vendor matching  
- structured specs  
- accelerated research timelines  

Our mission is simple:  
**Help the global biotech ecosystem move faster, collaborate better, and innovate more freely — while keeping the core technology open.**

# 🧩 Architecture at a Glance

BioMP is organized into three knowledge layers:

### **1️⃣ Central Knowledgebase (Shared Intelligence)**  
Broad, verified, and continuously improving understanding of:
- services  
- methods  
- vendors  
- capabilities  
- evidence  

### **2️⃣ Agent Brains (Specialized Intelligence)**  
Each agent has:
- its own knowledgebase  
- heuristics and domain rules  
- skill templates  
- decision frameworks  

Agents consume:
- Central KB  
- Project Memory  
- Their own brain  

### **3️⃣ Project Memory (Case-Specific Knowledge)**  
Private per-project workspace containing:
- user intent  
- artifacts  
- upload references  
- intermediate reasoning  
- final specs, shortlists, and reviews
